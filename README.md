# Maze-Game
___________________

This was a lab I did for a programming class.
This is a maze game developed in C where the user can choose their own difficulty and it generates the maze depending on the difficulty.
It is controlled through the DS4 (PlayStation 4) controllers using the ds4rd.exe.

How this works is that the user chooses their own difficulty and they will have to navigate their player using the DS4 controllers to find the exits. The user wins
if they find the exit of the maze and they lose if they get stuck and don't find their way out. 

Honestly, probably one of my favorite things I have done in C other than that I'm not a big fan of the language lol. 

Also, if you are a student taking the same class and are dealing with this lab, feel free to take a look at what I have done.
