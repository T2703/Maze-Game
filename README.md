# Maze-Game
___________________

This was a lab I did for a programming class, CPRE 185.
This is a maze game developed in C where the user can choose their own difficulty and it generates the maze depending on the difficulty.
It is controlled through the DS4 (PlayStation 4) controllers using the ds4rd.exe.

Technologies:
- C
- DS4 Controllers

How this works is that the user chooses their own difficulty and they will have to navigate their player using the DS4 controllers to find the exits. The user wins
if they find the exit of the maze and they lose if they get stuck and don't find their way out. 

Features:
- Maze generation based on difficulty.
- DS4 controller movement/support.
- Win mechanic based on escaping.
- Lose mechanic based on not escaping/getting stuck.
- Collision detection with the walls of the maze.

Honestly, probably one of my favorite things I have done in C other than that I'm not a big fan of the language lol. 
I do not condone the use or copying of these files. 
If you plan to use make sure you use it as a resource and DO NOT just copy.
